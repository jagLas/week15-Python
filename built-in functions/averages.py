# STEP 1: Complete analyze function to return 5 values
#    - minimum
#    - maximum
#    - mean (a.k.a. average)
#    - median (center point)
#    - mode (most repeated)
def analyze(nums):
    return ()

# STEP 2: Complete median function to return center number
#         WITHOUT using built-in function
def median(nums):
    return

# STEP 3: Complete mode function to return most-repeated number
#         WITHOUT using built-in function
# BONUS B: Catch special case where more than one value repeats the most
def mode(nums):
    return

# DO NOT EDIT - sample data for checking your work
sample1 = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
sample2 = [37,45,23,65,75,34,23,23,23,65,12,99]
print(('min', 'max', 'mean', 'median', 'mode'))
print(analyze(sample1))
print(analyze(sample2))

# BONUS A: Print more samples as you see fit
